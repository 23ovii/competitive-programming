## 📌 About

This repository contains solutions to competitive programming problems from multiple platforms:

- **[pbinfo.ro](https://pbinfo.ro)** — Romania's main algorithmic training platform (used in schools)
- **[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com)** — Popular international competitive programming platform
- **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)** — Industry coding interview practice
- **Additional platforms coming soon** 🚀

The file naming follows each platform's convention—problem IDs for easy reference and organization.

## 📊 Platforms Overview

### 🇷🇴 PBInfo.ro
Main training platform used in Romanian high schools. Solutions organized by:
- **Grade level** (9th, 10th, 11th)
- **Topic** (Subprograms, Recursion, Divide & Conquer, String Processing, etc.)
- Each file is named after its problem ID

### ⚡ Codeforces
Solutions to competitive programming contests and problems:
- Organized by contest/round
- File naming follows problem codes (e.g., `2188A.cpp`, `2188B.cpp`)

### 💼 LeetCode
Industry-focused coding interview practice (structure coming soon)

## 💡 Tips

> 📝 **Best Practice:** Try solving the problems yourself before checking the solutions — it's the best way to improve!

> 🚀 **Quick Navigation:** Solutions are organized by topic and difficulty, making it easy to find problems related to specific algorithms.

## 🎯 Contributing
